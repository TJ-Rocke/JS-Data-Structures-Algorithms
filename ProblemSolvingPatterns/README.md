## Frequency Counters

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings.

Useful when you have multiple pieces of data multiple inputs and you need to compare them and see if they consist of similar values, if they are anagrams, if a value is contained in other value - basically anytime you're comparing pieces of data, 2 or more inputs, and frequencies of certain things occur
